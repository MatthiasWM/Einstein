  Calling this script install-sh is preferred over install.sh, to prevent
  `make' implicit rules from creating a file called install from it
  when there is no Makefile.

  This script is compatible with the BSD install script, but was written
  from scratch.  It can only install one file at a time, a restriction
  shared with many OS's install programs.
